# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using structured customer data.

---

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on historical data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

## Technologies & Tools

- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Model evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Insights on key factors contributing to customer churn
